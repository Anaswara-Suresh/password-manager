### LockBox: An Offline Password Manager


LockBox is an offline password manager designed to be a secure and user-friendly alternative to complex or cloud-based solutions. It aims to combine strong encryption, such as **ChaCha20-poly1305** and **Argon2id**, with an intuitive interface to simplify password management for non-technical users. By storing all data locally, LockBox eliminates privacy risks associated with cloud storage and provides essential features like autofill and a timeout lock. The project is a partial duplication of key features from KeePassXC and Bitwarden, with a focus on enhancing usability and security for everyday users.
